# AI Chat Feedback Application

## Overview

This ReactJS application allows users to interact with an AI model, providing feedback on the AI's responses. Users can rate the AI's answers with thumbs up/thumbs down, give a 5-star rating at the end of the conversation, and provide subjective feedback. The application also allows users to view past conversations along with the feedback provided.

## Features

- **AI Chat Interaction**: Users can chat with a mock AI model that responds to their questions.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**:
  - **Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down**: Users can like or dislike the AI's response.
  - **Rating**: At the end of the conversation, users can rate the interaction on a scale of 1 to 5.
  - **Subjective Feedback**: Users can provide textual feedback.
- **View Past Conversations**: Conversations and their respective feedback can be saved and revisited.
- **View and Filter Feedback**: Users can view and filter feedback based on ratings across all conversations.
- **Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark modes.

## Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: For building the user interface.
- **Material-UI**: For pre-built UI components and design.
- **Redux**: For state management of the chat conversations and feedback.
- **CSS**: For custom styling, including support for dark and light modes.
- **JSON**: Mock data for AI responses.
